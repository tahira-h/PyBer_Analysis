SUMMARY

Three Business recommendations

There are three business recommondations for the CEO for addressing any disparitites among the city types. The first recommendation is, although the urban city performed with higher ranking data in contrast to suburban and rural city's, the urban cities performance changes per week. Resulting in awareness to not have limited expectations on the three city types when using PyBer. The second recommendation is to use this data to plan ways to improve the months decreasing total fares by city. The third recommendation is to use PyBer in whatever city type you are in.
